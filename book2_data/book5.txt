You have entered a place where Numbers are Real and Alive not merely symbols for other
things. " ~Marko Rodin [108]
Finally , it was Marko Rodin 's Vortex Based Mathematics , that crystallized the entire reality matrix
into one grand image . Rodin has discovered the underpinning geometry of the universe , the fabric
of time itself is a Torus or black hole. He has also discovered what dark energy is and the source of
the non-decaying spin of an electron , within a series of regularities in the decimal number system .
These patterns that lay out on the surface and within the internal volume of a torus , have been
overlooked or ignored by conventional science and mathematics . He also discovered that at the
heart of tours is a Merkaba and that the energy creating this structure is governed by the same
harmonic resonance properties known by the ancients . As Pythagoras once so aptly put it, “All is
Number”.

There is a great deal of information involved in Vortex Based Mathematics, especially since it is the
My Tarot Journey 49
Rodin studied all of the worlds religions , searching for answers in ancient texts.
In an effort to decipher the true meaning of the word Abha , which is "The Most
Great Name of God ", he decided to convert the letters into numbers . Since the
original Baha scriptures were written in Persian and Arab , he used the Abjad
numerical notation system , of allocating a unique numerical value to each
letter of the 28 letters of the alphabet so that secret quantum mechanic physics
could be encoded into words .
The image on the right shows 24 of the letters in the ancient language of
Hebrew together form the Star Tetrahedron [120]

form "12.51". If you add up each side of the decimal you get 3 and 6. It also gives the first 2 reciprocal
number pairs, 1 -1 and 2- 5. So he then decided to draw a circle with nine on top . Then he added other
numbers 1 through 8, going clockwise around the circle.
Its pronunciation produces a compression ("AB") and decompression
(" HA ") in the breath when spoken .1251 is the value of " ABHA " in
Abjad numerals (A = 1, B = 2, H=5) = 9. Nine is considered a "holy
number " in the Baha ' i faith , with their icon even being a 9-pointed
star . Also , other religious text spoke of nine as an omni -potent
number . He reasoned that thw word must be like a mirror because it
begins and ends in 1, so he placed a decimal point in the middle to
ultimate answer to the ultimate questions . It is the reason we are here and how we came to be.
However , I must try to keep it as brief as possible . All of the information I am providing in the
following section istaken directly fromRodin 's work [108][109][110][111][112][134][135]

Next, he reduced all higher mathematics (calculus , geometry , scalar math ) to discrete numbers ,
which revealed a blueprint , a schematic , that enables you to see all of the pathways and movement
that energy takes , in the past, present and future,on micro and macro level . He discovered that , not
only do numbers have temporal , spatial and volumetric qualities , but that they are elementary
particles of which everything is composed . This sequence called the "Symbol of Enlightenment ", is
the "Mathematical Fingerprint of God ".

" [113]
.
Important concepts taken from the Rodin Glossary, defining Polarized Fractal Geometry [113]
:
* Numbers have one of two Polarities (binary mechanical system).
* Numbers are archetypes . There are only 9 archetype numbers (1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9). This geometry is
founded upon the reduction of multi -digit numbers to their single -digit archetype value , using
Horizontal Addition.
* Numbers have specific geometric and spatial relationships to each other and especially to the
immutable Number 9.
* Numbers are naturally a trinity . There are three family Number Groups , with three unique numbers
which are separated by 3 in the linear number sequence (1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9).
* Polarized Fractal Geometry is derived from the Base Ten Counting System
* Numbers arrange in different sequences owing to the fractal nature of Torus.
* Numbers have temporal relationships to one another , being activated (rarefied ) in sequential
patterns.
* The number relationship explains the structure of matter and the movement of energy.
* The Symbol of Enlightenment and the Nexus Key model Polarized Fractal Geometry.
"The geometric number relationships of the Polarized Fractal Geometry are the underpinnings of the
universe and the keys to Alchemy" . The geometric arrangement of these numbers, coupled with the
function or energy of a number are the ultimate definition of the Rodin Torus .The fractal nature of the
torus lies in the tiling pattern , that is ever changing , like a kaleidoscope . There is an infinite number of
tori are possible . However , the number sequences and their relationships remain the same . The
Rodin Torus , "is a fractal torus attractor , a geometric phase-space , manifesting unit which brings
order from underlying Cha
There are nine simple multiplication series (one series for each discrete number 1-9). These
multiplication series are based upon reducing all products to single digits via "Horizontal Addition",

forming meaningful number sequence . These sequences
have bilateral or mirror symmetry that line up in stratified
layers of horizontal planes . A sequence of numbers
represents the physical world of matter in motion in 3D
space , that flow in circuits , consistent with Newton 's 3rd
Law , described as a finite , closed number systems [112]
.
Thus , VBM shows the relationships and thus the qualities ,
substance and position in 3-D space of numbers rather
than just the quantities of numbers
As mentioned previously , this pattern is created by
reducing every multiple digit number into a single digit
through addition , or by "casting out nines " (also known as
Modular -9 Arithmetic , Decimal Parityor Digital Root ,
Kabbalistic Reduction or Pythagorean Addition). Finding the
digital root of numbers (Vedic Squares) can be traced back

There are nine simple multiplication series (one series for
each discrete number 1-9). If we take the multiplication
table and reduce it to discrete numbers , we can see the
pattern begin to emerge . The first table is a regular
multiplication table, and on the right a multiplication table
with the 9's casted out. The last table shows just 1-9. Notice
the symmetry or mirror imaging of the numbers:

16 doubled is 32 (3 + 2 = 5)
Powers of 10 Circuit:
1 X 1 = 1
1 X 10 = 10 (0.5 or 5 X 2 = 10)
10 X 10 = 100 (0.25 or 25 X 4 = 100)
100 X 10 = 1,000 (0.125 or 125 X 8 = 1, 000)

Doubling Circuit:
32 doubled is 64 (6 + 4= 10, 1 + 0 = 1)
According to Rodin , the best way to understand this digital matrix , is to draw the symbol for ourselves
and watch its amazing properties unfold. Therefore, begin by drawing a circle. Next, place the number
sequence 1-9 on its periphery , running clockwise . Since nature uses the "doubling circuit " for fetal
development and cell growth , place your pencil on the number one. We know that one doubled is two ,
so draw a line to two , and so on, following the line clockwise and then counterclo
The significance of the Mayan calender is that 64 is one complete cycle of infinity . Therefore , it begins
again with 64 doubled is 128 and 1+2+8=11 (1+1=2), and so on. No matter how high you go, it will
always reduce back to its corresponding number on The Doubling Circuit . This is why there is an
infinity shape inside the circle. You are creating an ever-repeating pattern of 1, 2, 4, 8, 7, 5.
Now, start again at the one, but this time go backwards on the infinity symbol, by halving. Halving
Circuit:
1 halved is 0.5
0.5 halved is 0.25 (2 + 5 = 7)
0.25 halved is 0.125 (1 + 2 + 5 = 8)
0.125 halved is 0.0625 (6 + 2 + 5 = 13 = 4)
Forever staying on the route of 1,2,4,8,7,5 even backwards.
The same principle, holds true for powers of ten:
My Tarot Journey 54
Now, lets look at the 3, 6, 9 circuit, which is the red triangle symbol. The is at the top for a reason.
The 9 isself-similar,since anymultiple of 9 reduces back to 9.
9 X 1 = 9
9 X 2 = 18 (1 + 8 = 9)
9 X 3 = 27 (2 + 7 = 9)
9 X 4 = 36 (3 + 6 = 9)
Thisfigure also has a doubling/halving pattern that pulsates, oscillating back and forth between 3 and 6
(with 9 asthe axis).
3 doubled is 6
6 doubled is 12 (3)
12 doubled is 24 (6)
24 doubled is 48 (3)
6 halved is 3
3 halved is 1.5 (1 + 5 = 6)
1.5 halved is 0.75 (7 + 5 = 12 = 3)
0.75 halved is 0.375 (3 + 7 + 5 = 15 = 6)
Also note that, all of the lines of the symbol that shift towards the 3 add up to 3, while all those that
shift towards the 6 add up to 6:
8 + 7 = 15 (6) 1 + 2 = 3
9 + 6 = 15 (6) 9 + 3 = 12 (3)
1 + 5 = 6 8 + 4 = 12 (3)
2 + 4 = 6 7 + 5 = 12 (3)
3 + 3 = 6 6 + 6 = 12 (3)
You can also add up adjacent numers within the doubling circuit:
1 + 2 = 3 4 + 2 = 6
5 + 4 = 9 8 + 1 = 9
8 + 7 = 15 (6) 7 + 5 = 12 (3)
The 3 and 6 (with an axis of 9) create a different sequence of numbers: 3, 9, 6, 6, 9, 3, 3, 9, 6.
Multiples of 9:
Doubling Circuit of 3 and 6: Halving Circuit of 3 and 6:
My Tarot Journey 55
The 1,2,4,8,7,5 is the third dimension and the 3 and 6 is the fourth
dimension , which is the higher dimensional magnetic field of an
electrical coil. The 3, 9, and 6 always occur together with the 9 as
the control . The 3 and 6 are polar opposites that act like a magnet
that repel each other , so they will never be found next to one
another. They will always be separated by the 9. This is because the 3 and 6 represent each side of the
Yin/Yang and the 9 is the "S" curve. Everything is based on thirds, thus a trinary system... not dualities.
The 9 demonstrates the omni dimension called Spirit that always occurs within the center of the
magnetic field lines. The nine is Energy being manifested in this moment in our physical world. It is also
unique because it is the focal center, with the vertical upright axis. It is the singularity or the Primal
Point of Unity or a black hole. This is the missing particle in the universe known as Dark Matter.
If you tile this sequence, linking it end-to-end, you have toroidal rings of various sizes. The smallest one
you can make that keeps the rings intact that form the X and Y axes (as this symbol utilizes digits 1 - 9)
is a 9 X 9 grid:
Now we place the two sequence 6, 9, 3, 3, 9, 6 and 1, 2, 4, 8, 7, 5, between two copies of the sequence
that makes up the doubling circuit . One is going forwards ("positive " or doubling ) and the other
backwards ("negative" or halving) it forms the skin of the torus:

Shearing of Reciprocals
Doubling Circuits, Reciprocals & Shearing:
These three lines of numbers, move outwards from the center of the singularity , wrap around the
top of the torus, and back through the middle again to meet the other end, creating an "S- Curve"
like the Yin and Yang symbol.
These alternating positive (1-2-4-8-7-5) and negative (5-7-8-4-2-1) sequences on the doubling circuit
(black and white diamonds ), are sandwiched between the 6-9-3-3-9-6 (also called The Gap Space or
Equipotential Major Groove ) to form the grid that makes up the surface of the torus, called the
" Diamond Crystal Grain Lattice Structure ". These sequences also run against one another to form
reciprocals (that meet end-to-end), which is called shearing . Also note that the number grid itself is
outlined with 9's, marked with red lines.
My Tarot Journey 57
Now, take these two series of numbers and place it behind its corresponding number on symbol:
Polar Number Pairs
Notice that the series of each number is mirrored from the one across from it. For example:
2 is "positive", going up in units of two (2, 4, 6, 8, etc.)
7 is "negative", going down in units of two (7, 5, 3, 1, etc.)
1 = 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8
8 = 8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1
The same is true for 4 & 5 and 1 & 8:
4 = 4,8,3,7,2,6,1,5
5 = ,1,6,2,7, 3, 8,4
All of these pairs are identical , yet are moving in opposite directions . With 9 as the axis , everything to
the left of it is "negative " and everything to the right is"positive". The 9 polarizes all the other numbers ,
acting like a mirror . Therefore , these three groups of numbers are called Polar Number Pairs: 1-8, 2-7,
My Tarot Journey 58
and 4-5. The polar Number Pairs, also made of odd and even numbers:
1 is an odd positive ~ 8 is an even negative
2 is an even negative ~ 7 is an odd positive
3 is an odd positive ~ 6 is an even negative
4 is an even negative ~ 5 is an odd positive
Another key feature of this symbol is Circulation of
Numbers as they pass through the Primal Point of Unity,
the numbers " turn around ". For example , follow the
numbers 5 and 4 through the multiplication table, you
will notice that the next instance of 5 and 4 requires
you to cross the middle to get to the other side . The 4
switches to 5 at the center , known as " The Primal
Point of Unity" or "The Decimal Point Singularity".
You can also see these 3 Polar Number Pairs , are found opposite one another
on the torus skin , with the 9 as the axis between them ( image to the right).
Also note, that if you add the polar pairs together, the all equal 9! (Image below)
My Tarot Journey 59
The X -Axis can be thought of as any of the concentric rings you see when facing the pole of the
equator . Technically , there are 2 Y-Axiesthatformrings around the torus:
1-8 Polar Pair = Y-Axis
(the "vertical")
4-5 Polar Pair = X-Axis
(the "horizontal")
2-7 Polar Pair = Z-Axis
(EmanationsfromThe Primal Point ofUnity
Since 9 is the center , multiples of 1 are going up ,
multiples of 8 are going down , 4 is going left , and 5.The
polar pairs also account for how number lines are used
in a regular Cartesian coordinate system , since each pair
is both a positive and negative number . For example, 1
increases by units of 1 ( positive), 8 decrease by units of
1 (negative ), 4 decreases by units of 4 (positive), and 5
decreases by units of 4 (negative).
My Tarot Journey 60
Step 1 Step 2 Step 3
The first reciprocal pair is 1 and 1.
1 X 1 = 1
Moving one away in each direction
gives us reciprocals 5 and 2.
5 X 2 = 10 = 1
Moving one away from 5 and 2
gives us
reciprocals 7 and 4.
7 X 4 = 28 (2 + 8 = 10 = 1)
Moving one away from 4 and7
we getthe reciprocal pair
8 and 8
8 X 8 = 64 (6 + 4 = 10 = 1)
Once again, lets follow these number as they move through the symbol:
1 and 1, 2 and 5, 4 and 7, 8 and 8.
Paired Numbers
If you multiply any number, it isthe same as dividing by itsreciprocal on The Doubling Circuit, thus
each number will always paired of which there are three:
Family Number Groups & The Binary Triplet
There are other interactions between the groups 3-6-9 and the 1-2-4-8-7-5
within this symbol . For example , 3 + 1 = 4, 3 + 7 = 1, & 3 + 4 = 7, etc.. This
results in a forward motion of 3, while the 6 is backward . For example ,
1 + 6 = 7, 7 + 6 = 13 & 1 + 3 = 4, etc.
My Tarot Journey 61
Group 1 (1-4-7) Group 2 (2-5-8) Group 3 (3-6-9)
Forward Motion:
1 + 3 = 4
4 + 3 = 7
7 + 3 = 10 (1 + 0 = 1)
Forward Motion:
2 + 3 = 5
5 + 3 = 8
8 + 3 = 11 (1 + 1 = 2)
Forward Motion:
3 + 3 = 6
6 + 3 = 9
9 + 3 = 12 (1 + 2 = 3)
Backward Motion:
1 + 6 = 7
7 + 6 = 13 (1 + 3 = 4)
13 + 6 = 19 (1 + 0 = 1)
Backward Motion:
2 + 6 = 8
8 + 6 = 14 (1 + 4 = 5)
14 + 6 = 20 (2 + 0 = 2)
Backward Motion:
3 + 6 = 9
9 + 6 = 15 (1 + 5 = 6)
15 + 6 = 21 (2 + 1 = 3)
There is also oscillation between positive and negative numbers and family groups . For example ,
While 3 and 6 are positive , the 9 is negative and vice versa . And, if Family Number Group 1 is positive ,
the Family Number Group 2 will be negative and vice versa. This back and forth motion or "binary flipflop is calleda "Binary Triplet".
My Tarot Journey 62
The Cosmic Eggbeater
The Cosmic Eggbeater , also known as "The Unit ", is the unseen , geometric mechanism which
creates the Torus Field .It has been well established by the ancient that there is a relationship
between harmonics of sound and 2,3 and 4D geometry. The unit is a 3D field of energy which exists
within a field of 2D potential . The 4D draws upon the 3rd dimension, which is created by the union
of potentials within the eggbeater machine . Sound creates complex geometric mandalas , that
crystallizes energy into elements (Platonic Solids, cube , tetrahedron , dodecahedron , etc.). The
cosmic eggbeater is the reason life exists. The Torus makes it all happen. The unit is the center of all
organized matter , from electrons to galaxies. It is the "energy spine of matter"
[111] [113] [114]
.
The entire unit, is a gyroscopic, Star Tetrahedron, that vibrates at and emits a "Fundamental Tone".
This creates a series of harmonic overtones and undertones , that define the harmonic spiral paths
of matter. The overtones are mathematical function of the fundamental tone, that follows a specific
geometric series in a wavelength. This was known as the Lambdoma Matrix to the ancient Greeks ,
that expresses the relationship of sacred geometry to waves , which models the energy matter
interface of the universe.
The eggbeater is comprised of two intersecting fields of energy
that are shaped like Tetrahedrons (a 3-D Star of David ),
mirroring one another as they spin in opposite directions in a
harmonic ratio at the speed of light in the center of the toroid.
The Unit spins along The First 9-Axis (in red ) while the two
vortices that make up The Hourglass are formed perpendicular
to it. When they are placed based -to-base ,they share the same center point or "Primary Axis of Spin ",
whose apexes are pointing horizontally in opposite directions(180 degrees)shown in red.
My Tarot Journey 63
The vortexes are spinning so fast that they create a
singularity . This is where the rarefied energy is created
known as AFME (red arrows ). The positive emanations
impart spin and momentum to matter (positive Nested
Vortices ). The negative emanations create gravity ,
movement , flow and harmony within the torus (negative Nested Vortices or Negative Back draft
Counter space), that circulates the rarefy matter in and out of the torus (green and magenta lines ).
Their spiraling paths are defined by the " Harmonics of the Vortex Motion ". Each field oscillates at
specific harmonic frequencies (light or sound ), that fluctuates and changes , defined by the precise
angles of the tetrahedrons . It is these angles that determine how the toroid crystallizes , like The
Ennead star patterns made by The Harmonic Number Sequence . Even though it can assume any
wavelength , it will always stay in harmony.
Not only does it spin along its own axis, but the entire Unit
itself also rotates to form The Second 9- Axis (in black ).
The units axis shifts, while the First 9-Axis energy field is
spinning and ratcheting . This ratcheting changes their
angular harmonics , producing a pulsing movement
(oscillation) of the unit through space. As a result, complex
geometric Mandalas are inscribed on the inner surface of the surrounding sphere of spin . The axis
of spin (Second 9-Axis ) is responsible for creating more complex forms like DNA (a " link- Sausage "
molecules ). Together, their union creates the " Aeth Coalescence" and the "Rodin Torus Field".
Emanations, Phasing and Number Activation
Aetheron Flux Monopole Emanations

Dandelion Puff Principle
Aetherons cannot be seen or felt, cannot decay or bend , a re irresistible and can penetrate anything .
They are the reason for it all, "responsible for life as we know it". They are the Life Force of the
universe , that creates form and movement . They generate Synchronized Electricity that are
" instantly reacting , high inductance , dual magnetic field flows " ( magnetic fields ) . Aetheron
Emanations atthe center
ofthe torus
emanations are the transparent Z-Axis, which isn't the traditional Euclidean
geometry. Instead , VBM harnesses the secret of the upright vertical axis by
aiming all of the numbered quantum tiles over the torus surface topology at
a single point in the center.
The Emanations ( black arrows ) come out in thirds in all directions , as
demonstrated by Rodin 's "Dandelion Puff Principle "
[111]
. It is linear energy
that originates from the center of all mass , from the center of the atomic
nuclei , moving in a straight line, without deflection or deviation . All mass
wraps around the aetherons and all movement curves around the Aetheron
Flow. Thus, the emanations impar non-decaying spin to electrons.
Electrons do not orbit the elliptical shell about a nucleus. Electrons flow on a
logarithmic spiral , tunneling through the center of the atomic nucleus
which is like a little antenna (The Primal Point of Unity ). Electrons are
harmonic and predictable , following an Interferometry Numerical
Pattern . They don 't jump around, they change in frequency.
Electron Path
" linear Emanations of quasi-mass energy , traveling in a straight line from the center of mass (Aeth
Coalescence). They radiate outward in Phased-Array, to rarefy the diamond tiles. This rarefication is
spread over the torus skin, creating doubling circuits and Nested Vortices [111] [114] [113]
.

Rodin's Universe
The German physicist Werner Heisenberg (1927 ), states that the position and the velocity of an
object cannot both be measured exactly , at the same time , even in theory . The very concepts of
exact position and exact velocity together , in fact , have no meaning in nature [122]
. Rodin is capable of
determining the electron moment in all frames of reference . This enables him to “see ” infinitely
small or large , from the quantum level to the shape of galaxies and the universe [111] [114]
.
Marko Rodin's VBM

.
Every galaxy in the universe , is in the shape of a torus . The
black hole is a negative vortex where everything implodes –
swirled and compressed until it reaches the inner diameter
of the toroid , which is called the singularity . Spirit
emanates omnidirectional from this toroidal pinch. Matter
is drawn in at the top and ejected at the bottom . This is
the source of gravity , of all motion , and of time . It is what
causes everything to warp and spin . The universe reprocesses matter , by umatter as a coolant source
at the core of a black hole , and dissipate heat away from the center of the galaxy. When the old, dead
stars and planets are shot out of the white hole, it cools and amalgamates , forming new stars and
planets all over again. This is why our human bodies are made of stardust – we are made of countless
stars of the past. This is an endless cycle of rene
Activation Sequence
These emanations effect the numbers on the surface of the torus ( Number Activation ) in a particular
order . Only the positive numbers of one family group (1/6 of the numbers ) are activated at a time, at
180 degree angles . This "Phased Array" activation of various parts of the torus skin, creates a "Negative
Draft Counter Space " called Nested Vortices , which is the source of gravity . These vortices are present
in the gap spaces between matter due to the aetheron flow . Since aetherons deflect matter, these
My Tarot Journey 66
spaces are empty just like the center of an atom . Where there is a 9, there can be no solid matter[114]
.
The polar pairs 3 and 6, oscillates back and forth , while the 9 at the axis , causes the infinite doubling
circuit (1-2-4-8- 7-5 and 5-7-8-4-2-1), which is "visible matter " , to spin, compress and expand at the
polar ends. Thus, the torus acts as a pump, pulling number in at the top and ejecting them out the
bottom . All of the digits together form the Star Tetrahedron /Seed of Life geometry , which is
ultimately the " flow dynamic " of a torus, that describes the space- time- fabric.
There are three Family Number Groups fire in succession , followed by a rest interval (a four-cycle
process creating a two-cycle surge pump)" as follows: 2-1-3 rest, 2-1-3 rest...
